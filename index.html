        <section class="main-article">
            <P>
                CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s
                appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the world of known
                physics.
                <br>
                He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been created in the Big
                Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed
                course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing
                the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
                <br>
                If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a
                jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were
                not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
                <br>
                <br>
                “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.

            </P>
            <p>
                On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and
                that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
                <br>
                Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of
                astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of
                space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was
                roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of
                inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.

            </p>
            <p>
                Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could
                ever be proved.
                <br>
                If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy
                pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science
                and speculation.
                <br>
                Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of
                billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are
                unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy
                eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b> ‘As Big as It Gets’ </b>
                <br>
                <br>
                In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond the reach of
                particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct
                observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle
                space-time.
                <br>
                Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is
                huge, as big as it gets.”
                <br>
                He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
                <br>
                The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that permeates space and
                preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun.
                <br>
                Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic
                Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set
                of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

                            <div class="grid-text"><b>THE UNIVERSE</b> is just under 14 billion years old. From our position in the Milky Way galaxy, we can observe a sphere that is now about
                            92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery. Wherever we look, the universe has an even temperature</div>

                            <div class="grid-text"><b>NOT ENOUGH TIME</b> The universe is not old enough for light to have traveled the vast distance from one side of the universe to the other,
                            and there has not been enough time for scattered patches of hot and cold to mix into an even temperature.</div>

                            <div class="grid-text"><b>DISTANT COFFEE</b> At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope to look a mile in one direction. You see a coffee cup, and from the amount
                            of steam, you can estimate its temperature and how much it has cooled</div>

                            <div class="grid-text"><b>COFFEE EVERYWHERE</b> Now turn around and look a mile in the other direction. You see a similar coffee cup, at exactly the same temperature.
                            Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in every direction, you might want to look for another explanation.</div>

                            <div class="grid-text"><b>STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME</b> There has not been enough time to carry coffee cups from place to place before they get cold. But if all the coffee cups
                            were somehow filled from a single coffee pot, all at the same time, that might explain their even temperature.</div>

                            <div class="grid-text"><b>INFLATION</b> solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the universe
                            expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in the violently expanding energy field eventually grew into the
                            large-scale structures of the universe.</div>

                            <div class="grid-text"><b>FLUCTUATION</b> Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient fluctuations in swirls of polarized light in the cosmic
                            background radiation, which is energy left over from the early universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by
                            Einstein.</div>

                            <div class="grid-text"><b>EXPANSION</b> Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot expanding faster than light and cooling to an even temperature as
                            it expands. That is something like inflation. And the structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the
                            original pot.</div>
